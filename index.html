            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m a student at the University of Florida, where Iâ€™m pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Statistics. My academic journey is fueled by a strong interest in how artificial intelligence and machine learning can be harnessed to solve real-world problems and create a more equitable, sustainable future.</p>
            <p>On campus, Iâ€™m actively involved in several student organizations that reflect my values and passions. Iâ€™m a proud member of ColorStack, Out in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (oSTEM), and the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE). Within NSBE, I serve as a Director for the Trailblazers Initiative, a leadership development program designed to empower and mentor first-year students in engineering and tech.</p>
            <p>Iâ€™m also a member of Gator AI, a student-led community dedicated to exploring AI through hands-on projects and discussions, and I currently conduct research at GatorSense, UFâ€™s Machine Learning and Sensing Lab. There, I contribute to projects that apply intelligent sensing systems to domains such as healthcare, agriculture, and environmental monitoring.</p>
            <p>Outside of academics and research, Iâ€™m passionate about movement and balance. I spend my free time skateboarding, and I train with the UF Kickboxing Club, where Iâ€™ve found both discipline and community.</p>
            <p>I believe deeply in the potential of technologyâ€”especially AI and data-driven systemsâ€”to better the world when guided by empathy, ethics, and inclusivity. Whether through research, leadership, or community engagement, Iâ€™m committed to contributing to a future where innovation uplifts everyone.</p>
